      Pipelines is a Continuous Delivery (CD) tool that uses code as configuration and integrates directly within Bitbucket. It helps developers build, test, and deploy their code.</p>
    <p>
      Bitbucket Pipelines was born to help small to medium-sized development teams quickly set up a CD pipeline for their projects. In this project, I worked with the PM, engineers, and designers in SF to envision, deliver and iteratively improve on the product.

    <h2>The birth of Pipelines</h2>
    <p>
      In late 2015, the Bamboo Cloud team pivoted from building what was essentially a hosted version of <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo" target="_blank">Bamboo Server</a> into what they believed was a better way forward — Bitbucket Pipelines. If you're familiar with Bamboo, you'd know how powerful and feature-packed it was, but this came with a baggage. Setting up a build in Bamboo was complicated and hard to maintain. Teams were required to sign up for a different service to run their build, and this added unnecessary overhead for most cloud teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pipelines simplified that by using services like Docker as their build infrastructure, and using code as configuration to simplify configuration maintenance and let the user focus on their code instead.

    <h2>Getting up to speed</h2>
    <p class="nomargin">
      With no prior Continuous Delivery (CD) knowledge, I had moved from the Confluence team to join Pipelines, just as they were starting to work on them. This was a personal challenge for me considering how technical the product was. I distinctly remember being intimidated learning git in my previous job, so the idea of designing a tool for developers was pretty terrifying. Alas, I took the challenge and soldiered on.

    <p class="nomargin">
      In the first two weeks, I shadowed the massively-talented <a href="https://twitter.com/jam_sbryant" target="_blank">James Bryant</a>, leaning on his experience with CD and Bamboo to learn the high-level concepts of code delivery. Next, I signed up for a new Bamboo account and attempted to run my first build with it. Along the way, I documented this process, capturing blockers and pain points that I discover as a new user. This document was shared back with the team as a way to understand new user's pain points of onboarding into Bamboo.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my commute, I listened to the awesome "To Be Continuous" podcast by Heavybit, which discusses CD best practices and details the benefit of CD practices in today's technology teams.
