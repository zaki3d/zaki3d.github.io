      Pipelines is a Continuous Delivery tool that uses code as configuration and integrates directly within Bitbucket. It helps developers build, test, and deploy their code.</p>
    <p>
      Bitbucket Pipelines was born to help small to medium-sized development teams quickly set up a Continuous Delivery pipeline for their projects. In this project, I worked with the PM, engineers, and my fellow Bitbucket designers in SF to envision, deliver and iteratively improve the product.

    <h2>The birth of Pipelines</h2>
    <p>
      In late 2015, the Bamboo Cloud team pivoted from building what was essentially a hosted version of <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo" target="_blank">Bamboo Server</a> into what they believed was a better way forward — Bitbucket Pipelines. If you're familiar with Bamboo, you'd know how powerful and feature-packed it was, but this came with a baggage. Setting up a pipeline in Bamboo was complicated and hard to maintain. Teams were required to sign up for a different service to run their build, and this added unnecessary overhead for most cloud teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pipelines simplified that by using services like Docker as their build infrastructure, and using code as configuration to simplify pipeline maintenance and let the user focus on their code instead.

    <h2>Understanding code delivery</h2>
    <p>
      I had joined the Pipelines team when they were just starting to work on them. I've had some experience doing git and front-end from my previous job, but Continuous Delivery was new domain to me and I was pretty excited to dive in. For the first two weeks, I shadowed the massively-talented <a href="https://twitter.com/jam_sbryant" target="_blank">James Bryant</a>, learning the high-level concepts of code delivery and understanding the existing pain points with Bamboo. I then tried signing up for a new Bamboo account and attempted to run my first build </p>
