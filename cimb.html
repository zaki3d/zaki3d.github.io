      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p class="nomargin">
        One of the earliest works that I did at VLT Labs was a pitching project for a golfing event by the CIMB Bank Malaysia. As the main organiser of the event, CIMB has full creative control over the marketing, and was the primary client that we were pitching to.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary goal was to sell event tickets by generating hype around the event. With that in mind, I worked with my awesome designer-mentor, <a href="http://izwanismail.com" target="_blank">Izwan Ismail</a>, on the idea and art direction of our pitch.

      <h2>Content first</h2>
      <p class="nomargin">
        To build up interest among visitors, we dedicated more than 80% of the front page for contents. Big, sensational news gets surfaced above-the-fold, while more frequent real-time updates (pulled from the organiser's Twitter account) sits just below.

      <h2>Easy ticketing</h2>
      <p class="nomargin">
        Ticketing information was intentionally receded to emphasise on content, but still easily discoverable. Showing both pricing and event details up-front allows for easy comparison for the more price-conscious visitors.
