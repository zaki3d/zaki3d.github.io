      <p>As a kid growing up in Malaysia, I was exposed to art early on and quickly developed a fondness for the creative process. That fondness nurtured my current fascination with product design, which I approach with a user-centered thinking, striving to build products that are easy to use.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m currently working in Sydney for <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian</a> as a Designer. As part of the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bamboo</a> team, I help design a tool that helps thousands of developers build, test, and deploy quality code. I also occasionally sketch on <a href="http://instagram.com/zaki3d" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.

      <p>You can get in touch with me via <a href="https://twitter.com/zaki3d" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:zaki3d@gmail.com">e-mail</a>.</p>
