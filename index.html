      <p>As a kid growing up in Malaysia, I was exposed to art early on and quickly developed a fondness for the creative process. That fondness nurtured my current fascination with product design, which I approach with a user-centered thinking, striving to build products that are easy to use.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m currently working in Sydney for <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian</a> as a Designer. As part of the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence" target="_blank">Confluence</a> team, I help design a tool to help thousands of our customers collaborate on documents online. We are also a growing design team, and are always looking for designers. If you&rsquo;re interested, don&rsquo;t be shy to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/company/careers/teams/design" target="_blank">reach out to us</a>.</p>

      <p>As I&rsquo;m compiling my works, you might want to check out my occasional sketches on <a href="http://instagram.com/zaki3d" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. You can also get in touch with me via <a href="https://twitter.com/zaki3d">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:zaki3d@gmail.com">e-mail</a>.</p>
